1. The primary challenge was the creation of a data structure in multiple ways that was successful and optimized.
2. My approach involved breaking the problem down into smaller tasks and understanding them. Also testing and researching different data structures was useful.
3. To overcome roadblocks, besides using class material, I used the internet and looked to trends in the industry and what was commonly used and why.
4. This project broadened my perspective on software design by making me think about what data structure was most efficient to use and create.
5. This project improved my basic coding practices like notation, but also just improved my ability in general. The biggest improvement was probably in pre development and research.
